Variable types
==============

Cashflower includes various types of variables. Here's an overview:

            return interest_rates[t, stoch]

Description:

**1. Regular**

* This is the default variable type with values that depend on :code:`t` (time).
* The function requires a parameter :code:`t` and should return a numeric value.
* You can call it for a specific period (e.g., :code:`t=5`) to get a single float.
  When called without any parameters, it returns an entire array of results, useful for array-based calculations.
* It belongs to the :code:`Variable` class.

|

**2. Constant**

* Constant variable holds the same value for all periods.
* The function doesn't require any parameters and should return a numeric value.
* It can be called for a specific period (e.g., :code:`t=5`) or without any arguments, returning a float in both cases.
  It can still be used for array-based calculations thanks to broadcasting mechanisms.
* It belongs to the :code:`ConstantVariable` class.

|

**3. Array**

* Array variables significantly enhance runtime performance compared to regular ones.
* The variable's decorator should include an :code:`array` argument set to :code:`True` (:code:`@variable(array=True)`).
  The function doesn't require any parameters and should return an array of numeric values, matching the projection horizon's length.
* Similar to regular variables, it can be called for a specific period (e.g., :code:`t=5`) to return a single float.
  When called without parameters, it provides the entire array of results for array-based calculations.
* It belongs to the :code:`ArrayVariable` class.

|

**4. Stochastic**

* Stochastic variables are for models involving multiple stochastic runs.
* The function requires two parameters: :code:`t` and :code:`stoch`, returning a numeric value.
* It can be called for a specific period and stochastic scenario (e.g., :code:`t=5` and :code:`stoch=2`) to return a single float.
* It belongs to the :code:`StochasticVariable` class.

**Data Type**

All variables used in the model must be numeric. This is for two main reasons:

* Performance – using numeric variables allows us to take advantage of NumPy’s optimized number types and operations, which makes the model run faster.
* Organization – keeping the model focused on numbers and adding text (like names, categories, or descriptions) later helps keep things tidy and well-structured.
